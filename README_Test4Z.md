1. Click on the hamburger menu (three lines) icon at the top of the sidebar
2. Select Terminal ‚Üí Run Build Task 

<img src='images/image19.png' width='35%'>

3. After starting the build task, the terminal window will open, after the synchronisation and building of the application on the mainframe, you will get a success message (**exit code:0**)
4. Close the terminal from it's right top corner

## Run the DOGGOS application
1. Go to Zowe Explorer (Z icon in the VS Code Activity Bar)
1. Hover the ‚Äúzosmf‚Äù item in the DATA SET section in the sidebar and click on the magnifier icon
1. Fill in the data set: CUST0xy.PUBLIC to add all data sets with this prefix to Zowe Explorer (Use your userID number instead of CUST0xy) 
1. Expand the CUST0xy.PUBLIC.JCL data set and right-click on the RUNDOG
1. Select ‚ÄúSubmit Job‚Äù menu item, then click "Submit" from the pop-up window

4. For HUSKY-INDEX-VALUE change VALUE to 9
5. For OTHER-INDEX-VALUE change VALUE to 10
6. Change PIC 9(1) to PIC 9(2) for OTHER-INDEX-VALUE
7. Change OCCURS value in line 71 to 10
8. Copy block of code (lines 208-210)
9. Paste it after line 210
10. Change JINGO to the dog breed name you picked in step 3 (e. g.HUSKY) within the pasted block of code
11. Copy block of code (lines 139-142)
12. Paste it after line 143
13. Change JINGO to the dog breed name you picked in step 3 (e.g. HUSKY) within the pasted block of code
14. Use CTRL+S (or COMMAND+S) to save the changes

## Build the DOGGOS application

*(Building the application can be done by either following the initial build steps above just like following ```Hamburger Menu ‚Üí Terminal ‚Üí Run Build Task``` OR by following the Command Line Instructions below):*

1. Click on the hamburger menu (three lines) icon at the top of the sidebar
1. Select Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal
1. Make sure the command line starts with: ```developer@ws-<"a-long-number-here">:~/doggos-gse```
1. Issue the following command to build and deploy the application to a data set: ```syncz -c "bldz"``` and hit Enter key
	(Click ‚ÄúAllow or Paste‚Äù if you see the pop-up window asking about copying and pasting permissions)


## Run the DOGGOS application AFTER the change is made and the build run

1. Go to Zowe Explorer (Z icon in the VS Code Activity Bar)
2. Hover the ‚Äúzosmf‚Äù item in the DATA SET section in the sidebar and click on the magnifier icon.
3. Click on the CUST0xy.PUBLIC.INPUT data set  to edit it
4. Add the following lines with the name of the dog breed you chose in the code change
   
![Change](images/image06.png)

5. Use CTRL+S (or COMMAND+S) to save the changes
6. Expand the CUST0xy.PUBLIC.JCL data set and right-click on the RUNDOG
7. Select the ‚ÄúSubmit Job‚Äù menu item, then click "Submit" from the pop-up window
8. Click on the JOB number in the pop-up message in the right bottom corner to see the JOB output (if the notification disappears, you can hit the bell icon from the bottom-right corner to see)
9. Expand the ‚ÄúRUNDOG(JOBxxxxx)‚Äù and click on the RUN:OUTREP item to browse the program output (Repeat the 8th step if you cannot expand the job output)

The new dog breed ‚ÄúHUSKY‚Äù is listed and the counter reports 11 adopted HUSKY dogs.

## Debug

1. Let‚Äôs introduce a bug in the program data üôÇ Go to the input file and change the breed from ‚ÄúJINGO‚Äù to ‚ÄúJINGA‚Äù
2. Use CTRL+S (or COMMAND+S) to save the changes
3. Rerun the application by repeating the steps in the previous section (from the 6th step)
4. Open the output file and see that the report is wrong, it now contains 0 for JINGO and 6 for the OTHER
5. Let‚Äôs debug the program
6. Go to debugger extension by clicking the play icon with a bug <img src='images/image22.png' width='4%'> shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+D (or COMMAND+SHIFT+D)
7. We already have the debugging session preconfigured for DOGGOS app. Make sure you are using the first configuration (**non-endevor**)

<img src='images/image21.png' width='35%'>

8. Click the play button to start the debugging

<img src='images/image10.png' width='50%'>

9. You will be asked for your Mainframe password. It is the same as your  mainframe userID. Now the debugger will fetch the extended source and start the session.
10. Now where to put a breakpoint?
11. The report for JINGO breed was wrong, so let‚Äôs put a breakpoint where the value is updated. Let‚Äôs find the first place in the code by searching for JINGO with Ctrl+F (CMD+F on Mac).
12. We can see that processing for JINGO breed is handled by these variables.
13. Let‚Äôs find all instances where JINGO-BREED-NAME by right-clicking on it, and selecting Peek ‚Üí Peek references. Go through the references to find where the amount is updated. It will be here around line 238 in extended source:

![Peek](images/image11.png)

14. Double-click on the 238 line in the editor window to move there.
15. Now let‚Äôs add a breakpoint after this condition to see if we get there.
Click on the left area on line 239. The red dot will appear

<img src='images/image12.png' width='65%'>

16. The value for OTHER breeds was wrong in the repo. Let‚Äôs put there a breakpoint as well
That would be on line 245

<img src='images/image13.png' width='65%'>

17. We now have 2 breakpoints (you can see them in breakpoints section in the bottom left corner):

<img src='images/image14.png' width='30%'>

18. Now let‚Äôs continue the execution by clicking the play button on the left of the debug toolbar (or F5):

<img src='images/image23.png' width='30%'>

19. We can see that while looping through the breeds the debugger skipped the breakpoint on line 239 and stopped at line 245

<img src='images/image16.png' width='65%'>

20. Let‚Äôs check the variables. Click on the INP-ADOPTED-AMOUNT variable, right-click, and ‚ÄúAdd to watch‚Äù
21. Do the same for the INP-DOG-BREED variable on line 216 to understand which breed we are analyzing
22. You can see in your watch section the value of the variables (BTW, a quick way is just to hover over a variable name in your extended source and the value will pop up)

<img src='images/image18.png' width='40%'>

23. As you can see we have encountered a wrong breed name ‚ÄúJINGA‚Äù, which means that our input file is corrupted! We also never entered a section for the JINGO breed, which means we never actually encountered this breed while parsing.
24. Now we found our problem - wrong breed in the input file :)
25. Stop the debug session by clicking the stop icon from the debugging toolbar.

## Test and Code Coverage

Let's look at the same code but from a unit test viewpoint. We'll use Test4z to validate if the code is working as expected (or not!). It will also confirm our unit test code is exercising all the production code, not just some of it.

26. Start by opening a new Visual Studio Code workspace on the doggos-app/DOGGOS folder (File > Open Folder... and select /home/developer/doggos-app/DOGGOS/).
27. In the EXPLORER pane, find the unit test COBOL module test/ZTTDOGOS.cbl (File > Go to File... ZTTDOGOS.cbl).

Note: This workshop won't cover how to write unit test code in Test4z. If you're interested, ask about the dedicated Test4z workshop!

28. Select the ZTTDOGOS.cbl unit test COBOL module and choose the pop-up menu option > Test4z Run Test with Coverage.

Note: You can also run your unit tests from the CLI using t4z test --cov (where --cov means "with code coverage")

29. Once completed, you should see a new folder called "coverage". Select it and choose the pop-up menu option > Test4z Open Coverage Dashboard.

<img src='images/test4z/image1.png' width='30%'>
      
30. This high-level view shows how many COBOL statements were executed. The goal is 100%. Test4z can help you find out just how close your unit testing is to this ideal.
31. Let's look more closely by clicking the "ZTPDOGOS.cbl" link in the dashboard.

Reminder: The ZTTDOGOS.cbl is the unit test code; ZTPDOGOS.cbl is the production code.

This shows the tested COBOL source code with "hit" statistics on each line of code. Scroll down to the executable code in the PROCEDURE DIVISION. Below is an example dashboard (your statistics may be slightly different, depending on prior workshop steps):

<img src='images/test4z/image2.png' width='30%'>
 
32. Visual Studio Code editor also shows code coverage annotations. Select File > Go > Go to File... src/ZTPDOGOS.cbl. Scroll down to see the green/red code coverage annotations of the PROCEDURE DIVISION.

<img src='images/test4z/image3.png' width='30%'>

# Side Scenarios
Start by opening a new Visual Studio Code workspace on the doggos-app folder (File > Open Folder... and select /home/developer/doggos-app/).

## Build a COBOL source on your PC with just 4 lines of code!!

1. Navigate to the following folder: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
1. Expand the src/ folder and you will see two COBOL source files, which we will build as a part of this scenario
1. Locate the BUILDZ.js file in the /root and double-click to edit it
1. Uncomment the first two lines, that initialize the compile and binder variables.
1. Uncomment the third line to compile the source code in the /src folder which creates an object module (syncz.yml file automatically downloads the object modules to the /build-out folder
1. Run the ```syncz -a ‚Äúsrc::bldz``` command to run the compilation enabled by uncommenting the line in the previous step
1. Uncomment the fourth line to bind the object modules created in the previous steps, which automatically creates a load module and downloads it to the /build-out folder
1. Run the ```‚Äúsyncz -a ‚Äúsrc::bldz‚Äù``` command to run the bind enabled by uncommenting the line in the previous step

## Automation with Zowe

### GSE NodeJS

This project demonstrates how to build and test a primitive Node.js server and then deploy and run it on the mainframe using Zowe CLI. 
To use this scenario switch to ```gse-nodejs``` folder by clicking the menu button in the top left corner and picking ‚ÄúFile‚Äù > ‚ÄúOpen Folder‚Ä¶‚Äù > ```/home/developer/gse-nodejs``` You can continue with reading the same text in ```gse-nodejs/README.MD```

To open the terminal window use the menu in the top left corner > ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù > ‚ÄúNew Terminal‚Äù

#### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Zowe CLI is installed and the profile is configured. This part should be done already, if not, we will need to manually [install Zowe CLI](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-installcli) and run ```scripts/configure-zowe-cli.sh <user-id>``` to configure the local profile.
- Node.js is installed on zDNT and is accessible in PATH, at the moment it is not included in the PATH, so we should create a basic ```.profile``` for the user by running ```scripts/configure-remote-profile.sh <your-user-id>```

#### Installation

This demo describes the automation case, so all the tasks can be done by running one command:
```bash
npm run start
```
Automation in detail is represented by a set of scripts under ```scripts/*```

For testing purposes or to try the Node JS server locally, use these commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run test
npm run start-dev
```


#### Deployment and Execution on Mainframe

After the server files are built locally the automation script packs server source code with dependencies to the server.tar and then sends it to the user's home directory on the mainframe using Zowe CLI. 

<details>
  <summary>Script</summary>

    #!/bin/bash

    echo ">>>>>> upload.sh: update server location in run script"
    sed "s|TARGET_DIR|$TARGET_DIR|g" "$LOCAL_DIR/scripts/templates/run-template.sh" > "$LOCAL_DIR/src/run.sh"

    echo ">>>>>> upload.sh: create a tar archive"
    tar -cf server.tar src node_modules public package.json package-lock.json

    echo ">>>>>> upload.sh: upload the archive to ${TARGET_DIR}/server.tar"
    zowe uss iss ssh "rm -r ${TARGET_DIR} 2>/dev/null"
    zowe uss iss ssh "mkdir ${TARGET_DIR}" 
    zowe files ul ftu -b "server.tar" "${TARGET_DIR}/server.tar"

    echo ">>>>>> upload.sh: extract and remove ${TARGET_DIR}/server.tar"
    zowe uss iss ssh "tar -xf server.tar 2>/dev/null" --cwd $TARGET_DIR
    zowe uss iss ssh "rm server.tar 2>/dev/null" --cwd $TARGET_DIR

    echo ">>>>>> upload.sh: update files permissions"
    zowe uss iss ssh "chown -R $USER_ID ./ 2>/dev/null" --cwd $TARGET_DIR
    zowe uss iss ssh "chtag -tRc ISO8859-1 ./ 2>/dev/null" --cwd $TARGET_DIR
    zowe uss iss ssh "chmod +x ./src/run.sh 2>/dev/null" --cwd $TARGET_DIR

</details><br>

As a result ```/u/users/<user-id>/server``` folder is created in USS.

Then we define a job to start the server, upload it to the dataset, submit, and wait for the output.

<details>
  <summary>Script</summary>

    echo ">>>>>> start-server.sh: create sequential data set for job"
    zowe zos-files create data-set-sequential $HLQ.NJSERVER
    sed "s|TARGET_DIR|$TARGET_DIR|g" "$LOCAL_DIR/scripts/templates/job-template.txt" > "$LOCAL_DIR/scripts/job.txt"

    echo ">>>>>> start-server.sh: upload job to the data set"
    zowe files upload file-to-data-set "$LOCAL_DIR/scripts/job.txt" "$HLQ.NJSERVER" 

    echo ">>>>>> start-server.sh: submit job to run the server"
    zowe jobs submit data-set "$HLQ.NJSERVER" --vasc > ./output.txt
    zowe files delete data-set "$HLQ.NJSERVER" -f

</details><br>

In this step, we create ```<user-id>.NJSERVER``` data set containing job to start the server and submit it. 
For the demo purposes server will run for 60 seconds and stop automatically, then delete the dataset.
While the server is running, we can check it is up by running the cURL command 
```curl --head 10.1.2.73:60111```


#### Conclusion

This demo scenario shows how to use a combination of NodeJS, bash, and Zowe CLI commands to provision the lifecycle of a simple Node JS server and can be used as a startup or reference point for creating a development pipeline. 

For more information on Zowe CLI and its capabilities, refer to the official Zowe documentation: [Zowe CLI Documentation](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-using-usingcli)
