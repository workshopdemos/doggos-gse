1. Click on the hamburger menu (three lines) icon at the top of the sidebar
2. Select Terminal ‚Üí Run Build Task 

<img src='images/image19.png' width='35%'>

3. After starting the build task, the terminal window will open, after the synchronisation and building of the application on the mainframe, you will get a success message (**exit code:0**)
4. Close the terminal from it's right top corner

## Run the DOGGOS application
1. Go to Zowe Explorer (Z icon in the VS Code Activity Bar)
2. Hover the ‚Äúzosmf‚Äù item in the DATA SET section in the sidebar and click on the magnifier icon. Enter CUST0xy in the search field and hit enter. Note that CUST0xy is the mainframe user id that is shared by your instructor. 
3. Fill in the data set: CUST0xy.PUBLIC to add all data sets with this prefix to Zowe Explorer (Use your userID number instead of CUST0xy) 
4. Expand the CUST0xy.PUBLIC.JCL data set and right-click on the RUNDOG
5. Select ‚ÄúSubmit Job‚Äù menu item, then click "Submit" from the pop-up window

3. Change JINGO to another dog breed name (e. g. HUSKY) in the whole pasted block of code
4. For HUSKY-INDEX-VALUE change VALUE to 9
5. For OTHER-INDEX-VALUE change VALUE to 10
6. Change PIC 9(1) to PIC 9(2) for OTHER-INDEX-VALUE
7. Change OCCURS value in line 71 to 10
8. Copy block of code (lines 208-210)
9. Paste it after line 210
10. Change JINGO to the dog breed name you picked in step 3 (e. g.HUSKY) within the pasted block of code
11. Copy block of code (lines 139-142)
12. Paste it after line 143
13. Change JINGO to the dog breed name you picked in step 3 (e.g. HUSKY) within the pasted block of code

   Please note to enter two records for HUSKY as listed in above screenshot. 

5. Use CTRL+S (or COMMAND+S) to save the changes
6. Expand the CUST0xy.PUBLIC.JCL data set and right-click on the RUNDOG
7. Select the ‚ÄúSubmit Job‚Äù menu item, then click "Submit" from the pop-up window
8. Click on the JOB number in the pop-up message in the right bottom corner to see the JOB output (if the notification disappears, you can hit the bell icon from the bottom-right corner to see)
9. Expand the ‚ÄúRUNDOG(JOBxxxxx)‚Äù and click on the RUN:OUTREP item to browse the program output (Repeat the 8th step if you cannot expand the job output)

The new dog breed ‚ÄúHUSKY‚Äù is listed and the counter reports 11 adopted HUSKY dogs.

## Debug

1. Let‚Äôs introduce a bug in the program data üôÇ Go to the input file and change the breed from ‚ÄúJINGO‚Äù to ‚ÄúJINGA‚Äù
2. Use CTRL+S (or COMMAND+S) to save the changes
3. Rerun the application by repeating the steps in the previous section (from the 6th step)
4. Open the output file and see that the report is wrong, it now contains 0 for JINGO and 6 for the OTHER
5. Let‚Äôs debug the program
6. Go to debugger extension by clicking the play icon with a bug <img src='images/image22.png' width='4%'> shortcut: CTRL+SHIFT+D (or COMMAND+SHIFT+D)
7. We already have the debugging session preconfigured for DOGGOS app. Make sure you are using the first configuration (**non-endevor**)

<img src='images/image21.png' width='35%'>

8. Click the play button to start the debugging

<img src='images/image10.png' width='50%'>

9. You will be asked for your Mainframe password. It is the same as your  mainframe userID. Now the debugger will fetch the extended source and start the session.
10. Now where to put a breakpoint?
11. The report for JINGO breed was wrong, so let‚Äôs put a breakpoint where the value is updated. Let‚Äôs find the first place in the code by searching for JINGO with Ctrl+F (CMD+F on Mac).
12. We can see that processing for JINGO breed is handled by these variables.
13. Let‚Äôs find all instances where JINGO-BREED-NAME by right-clicking on it, and selecting Peek ‚Üí Peek references. Go through the references to find where the amount is updated. It will be here around line 238 in extended source:

![Peek](images/image11.png)

14. Double-click on the 238 line in the editor window to move there.
15. Now let‚Äôs add a breakpoint after this condition to see if we get there.
Click on the left area on line 239. The red dot will appear

<img src='images/image12.png' width='65%'>

16. The value for OTHER breeds was wrong in the repo. Let‚Äôs put there a breakpoint as well
That would be on line 245

<img src='images/image13.png' width='65%'>

17. We now have 2 breakpoints (you can see them in breakpoints section in the bottom left corner):

<img src='images/image14.png' width='30%'>

18. Now let‚Äôs continue the execution by clicking the play button on the left of the debug toolbar (or F5):

<img src='images/image23.png' width='30%'>

19. We can see that while looping through the breeds the debugger skipped the breakpoint on line 239 and stopped at line 245

<img src='images/image16.png' width='65%'>

20. Let‚Äôs check the variables. Click on the INP-ADOPTED-AMOUNT variable, right-click, and ‚ÄúAdd to watch‚Äù
21. Do the same for the INP-DOG-BREED variable on line 216 to understand which breed we are analyzing
22. You can see in your watch section the value of the variables (BTW, a quick way is just to hover over a variable name in your extended source and the value will pop up)

<img src='images/image18.png' width='40%'>

23. As you can see we have encountered a wrong breed name ‚ÄúJINGA‚Äù, which means that our input file is corrupted! We also never entered a section for the JINGO breed, which means we never actually encountered this breed while parsing.
24. Now we found our problem - wrong breed in the input file :)
25. Stop the debug session by clicking the stop icon from the debugging toolbar.

# Test Challenge

The activities in this test challenge are:

1. *Generate Test Coverage Report:* Running tests and generating a report to visualize code coverage.
2. *Edit a Test Case:* Modifying a specific test case to change expected outcomes and observing the results.
3. *Add a Test4z Statement to a Test File:* Inserting a Test4z statement into the test code to demonstrate how to use Test4z snippets.

## Generate Test Coverage Report

From the Cloude IDE Window, Select the HamBurger icon on the top left (three horizontal lines) and then 
Select View and Command Palette. Reference screenshot: 

<img src='images/test4z/image_command_palette.png' width='65%'>

Enter ‚ÄúTest4z Run All Tests with Coverage‚Äù like on the following screenshot:

<img src='images/test4z/image_command_palette_run_all_tests_cov.png' width='65%'>

This will run the tests and generate the report.

<img src='images/test4z/image_coverage_report.png' width='85%'>

The Code Coverage dashboard will be opened automatically:

<img src='images/test4z/image_report_all_files.png' width='85%'>

To see the statement-level code coverage, click on the `DOGGOS.cbl` file in the report:

<img src='images/test4z/image_statement_level_coverage.png' width='85%'>

## Edit a Test Case

Open the [`TDOGGOS.cbl`](DOGGOS/COBTEST/TDOGGOS.cbl#L266) file under `DOGGOS`/`COBTEST` folder and edit the test case.

Find `MOVE 008 TO EXPECTED_ADOPTIONS(1).` and change it to `MOVE 009 TO EXPECTED_ADOPTIONS(1).`.

Code after change:

<pre>
       DEFINE_EXPECTED_DATA.
           MOVE <b>009</b> TO EXPECTED_ADOPTIONS(1).
           MOVE 000 TO EXPECTED_ADOPTIONS(2).
</pre>

From the command line, run the `t4z` command.

Expected output:

```
 FAIL  DOGGOS/COBTEST/TDOGGOS.cbl
  ‚úì DOGGOS simple run (123 ms)
  ‚úï DOGGOS validate accumulator (436 ms)
      Assertion error: Invalid accumulator value
      SYSOUT:
      THIS PROGRAM WILL CALCULATE AMOUNT OF ADOPTED DOGGOS PER SOME PERIODS OF TIME
      TODAY IS :2024
      Mismatch for index 0000000001
      Actual 008
      Expected 009
  ‚úì DOGGOS force open error (141 ms)
  ‚úì DOGGOS force read error (570 ms)

Tests Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
Tests:        1 failed, 3 passed, 4 total
Time:         1 s
```

You will observe that the test run is a failure. The actual value is `008` but we have the expected value to be `009`.

Before continuing, revert the change back to:
<pre>
           MOVE <b>008</b> TO EXPECTED_ADOPTIONS(1).
</pre>

## Add a Test4z Statement to the Test File

Open the [`TDOGGOS.cbl`](DOGGOS/COBTEST/TDOGGOS.cbl#L136) file under `DOGGOS`/`COBTEST` folder and edit the test case.

Find `Implementation for TEST1`. That will get you to this code:

<pre>
      ********************************************************
      * Implementation for TEST1
      ********************************************************
           ENTRY 'TEST1'
           <small><i>(Place your cursor here)</i></small>
      *    Mock all external resources
           PERFORM MOCK_ADOPTS_FILE
</pre>

Add a new line after `ENTRY 'TEST1'`.
Move the cursor the start of Area B (column 12) and type `t4z me`.
The IntelliSense will offer you possible code completions using the Test4z snippets as you can see in the screenshot:

<img src='images/test4z/image_test1.png' width='65%'>

Select ‚Äút4z Message write‚Äù.

This will fill in the code for you:

<img src='images/test4z/image_code_snippet.png' width='65%'>

Replace `'Your Message'` with `'Hello Test4z!'` and save the file with code like that:

<pre>
           ENTRY 'TEST1'
           move low-values to I_Message in ZWS_Message
           move '<b>Hello Test4z!</b>' to messageText in ZWS_Message
           call ZTESTUT using ZWS_Message
</pre>

From the command line, run `t4z`. The expected output is:

<pre>
‚ùØ t4z

 PASS  DOGGOS/COBTEST/TDOGGOS.cbl
  ‚úì DOGGOS simple run (110 ms)
      <b>Hello Test4z!</b>
  ‚úì DOGGOS validate accumulator (500 ms)
  ‚úì DOGGOS force open error (410 ms)
  ‚úì DOGGOS force read error (680 ms)

Tests Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:        4 passed, 4 total
Time:         2 s
</pre>

## Summary

This demo scenario demonstrates how to generate a test coverage report, edit a test case, and add Test4z statements to a test file.
